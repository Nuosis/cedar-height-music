# Contact Form Input Width Investigation

## Symptom
Contact form inputs (name, email, phone, message) are constrained to approximately 50% width instead of taking the full available width within their container, despite having width: 100% CSS property. We know this because:
- User reports inputs appear ~50% width
- CSS shows .form-input has width: 100%
- User wants inputs to be 2x wider without changing container width

## Steps to Recreate
1. Navigate to contact page
2. Observe form inputs appear to be only ~50% of their container width
3. Inspect CSS - inputs have width: 100% but are still constrained
4. User wants inputs to be 2x wider without changing container width

## Attempts to Solve the Problem
1. Checked .contact-layout grid (uses 2fr 1fr, not 1fr 1fr)
2. Verified .form-input has width: 100%
3. Searched for max-width constraints on form elements
4. Attempted scaling transform (rejected as wrong approach)
5. Looked at wireframe HTML which shows max-width: 800px on container but that affects container not input width
6. Searched for width constraints on form-input, form-group, form-row classes

## Hypotheses

1. **CSS Box Model Constraints** (Most Fundamental)
   - hypothesis: Form inputs have padding/border/margin that reduces effective width
   - null hypothesis: Box model properties don't constrain the visual input width

2. **Parent Container Width Constraint**
   - hypothesis: .contact-form-wrapper or .contact-form has a width constraint limiting input space
   - null hypothesis: Parent containers allow full width for inputs

3. **CSS Grid/Flexbox Layout Issues**
   - hypothesis: CSS Grid or Flexbox properties on parent elements constrain input width
   - null hypothesis: Layout properties allow inputs to use full available space

4. **Inherited CSS Rules**
   - hypothesis: Other CSS rules override or conflict with .form-input width: 100%
   - null hypothesis: .form-input width: 100% is the effective rule applied

5. **CSS Specificity Conflicts**
   - hypothesis: More specific CSS rules override the width: 100% property
   - null hypothesis: No more specific rules override the width property

6. **Browser Default Styles** (Most Dependent)
   - hypothesis: Browser default input styles constrain width
   - null hypothesis: Browser defaults don't interfere with custom width styles
