# Mobile Navigation Investigation Results

## Evidence Analysis

### Hypothesis 1: React State Logic Inversion
**Status: ‚úÖ ELIMINATED - NULL HYPOTHESIS PROVEN TRUE**

**Evidence from Console Logs:**
```
Initial State:
[2025-08-29T02:09:19.927Z] Header render - mobileOpen state: false
[2025-08-29T02:09:19.928Z] Mobile menu render - mobileOpen: false, active class: not applied

First Click (Hamburger ‚Üí X):
[2025-08-29T02:09:49.257Z] Hamburger clicked - current mobileOpen: false
[2025-08-29T02:09:49.258Z] State changing from false to true
[2025-08-29T02:09:49.258Z] Header render - mobileOpen state: true
[2025-08-29T02:09:49.259Z] Mobile menu render - mobileOpen: true, active class: applied

Second Click (X ‚Üí Hamburger):
[2025-08-29T02:10:21.377Z] Hamburger clicked - current mobileOpen: true
[2025-08-29T02:10:21.377Z] State changing from true to false
[2025-08-29T02:10:21.377Z] Header render - mobileOpen state: false
[2025-08-29T02:10:21.378Z] Mobile menu render - mobileOpen: false, active class: not applied
```

**Conclusion:** React state logic is working correctly. State changes from false‚Üítrue‚Üífalse as expected.

### Hypothesis 2: CSS Class Application Logic
**Status: ‚úÖ ELIMINATED - NULL HYPOTHESIS PROVEN TRUE**

**Evidence:** Console logs show the `active` class is correctly applied when `mobileOpen: true` and removed when `mobileOpen: false`.

**Conclusion:** CSS class application logic is working correctly.

### Hypothesis 3: CSS Transform Animation Logic
**Status: üîç REQUIRES INVESTIGATION**

The React state and CSS classes are working correctly, but the user reports inverted behavior. This suggests the CSS transform values may be inverted.

### Hypothesis 4: Hamburger Icon State Logic
**Status: üîç REQUIRES INVESTIGATION**

Need to verify if hamburger icon transforms are synchronized with menu state.

### Hypothesis 5: CSS Media Query Conflicts
**Status: üîç REQUIRES INVESTIGATION**

Need to examine CSS rules for conflicts.

### Hypothesis 6: Event Handler Logic
**Status: ‚úÖ ELIMINATED - NULL HYPOTHESIS PROVEN TRUE**

**Evidence:** Console logs show click handler correctly toggles state in the right direction.

## Root Cause Analysis

Based on the evidence, **Hypotheses 1, 2, and 6 are eliminated**. The React state management, CSS class application, and event handling are all working correctly.

The issue must be in the **CSS transform animation logic** or **hamburger icon state synchronization**.

## Next Steps

1. Examine CSS transform values for the mobile menu
2. Verify hamburger icon animation synchronization
3. Check for CSS conflicts in media queries
