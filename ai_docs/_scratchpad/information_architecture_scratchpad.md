## Current IA from PRD

- Pricing (/pricing) - Billing frequency, indicative pricing
- Enroll (/enroll) - 3-step configurator

## Notes During Discussion
- **Flow Decision**: Keep current structure (Home → About → Pricing → Enroll) as essential trust-building steps
- **Trust-building priority**: Parents need confidence before committing to configurator
- **Teacher Profiles**: Minimal approach - photos, name, primary instruments, brief bio (performance-focused)
- **Configurator Flow**: Keep instrument → timeslot → billing (builds commitment before price reveal)
- **Scalability**: Focus on current needs - "deal with the future in the future" (YAGNI approach)
- **Ready to compile**: All key IA decisions confirmed
