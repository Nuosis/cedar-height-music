# Information Architecture Scratchpad - Cedar Heights Music

## Key Context from Documents
- **Business Goal**: 20% enrollment increase in 6 months
- **Primary User**: Parents of K-12 students in Cedar/Nanaimo BC
- **Core Journey**: Discovery → Trust Building → Enrollment
- **Handoff**: Redirect to protected app with context params
- **Timeline**: 2 weeks, mock→live data switch

## Current IA from PRD
- Home (/) - Hero + primary CTA
- About (/about) - Studio story, teacher bios
- Pricing (/pricing) - Billing frequency, indicative pricing
- Enroll (/enroll) - 3-step configurator
- Contact (/contact) - Client-side form
- Privacy (/privacy) + Terms (/terms) - Static pages

## Notes During Discussion
- **Flow Decision**: Keep current structure (Home → About → Pricing → Enroll) as essential trust-building steps
- **Trust-building priority**: Parents need confidence before committing to configurator
- **Teacher Profiles**: Minimal approach - photos, name, primary instruments, brief bio (performance-focused)
- **Configurator Flow**: Keep instrument → timeslot → billing (builds commitment before price reveal)
- **Scalability**: Focus on current needs - "deal with the future in the future" (YAGNI approach)
- **Ready to compile**: All key IA decisions confirmed

## Enhancement Requirements (Command 02)
- **Authority-Aligned IA**: Need to integrate Figma design system authority with IA structure
- **Component-Level IA**: Navigation indicators, CTA hierarchy, form flows aligned with design standards
- **Validation Framework**: Measurable criteria for navigation efficiency, user flow success
- **Cross-Phase Handoff**: Specifications for wireframe and high-fidelity phases
- **Responsive IA Strategy**: How structure adapts across breakpoints
- **Asset Integration**: How seasonal backgrounds and character elements support IA

## Missing Sections to Add
1. Authority-Aligned IA Development (Visual Authority Integration, Measurable IA Standards)
2. Component-Level Information Architecture (Navigation Indicators, CTA Placement Strategy)
3. Validation-Ready IA Framework (Structural Validation Criteria, Testing Framework Preparation)
4. Cross-Phase Continuity (Handoff specifications for phases 03 and 04)
5. Responsive IA Strategy (Breakpoint-specific adaptations)
