# CSS Modal Spacing Investigation - Third Attempt

## Symptom
In the CSS modal (coming soon modal), there is an enormous gap between the 'STUDENT NAME' label and its corresponding input field that is unwarranted and visually unappealing. We know this because:
- Visual inspection shows excessive spacing between label and input
- Gap is significantly larger than expected for normal form spacing
- User confirmed this is NOT a margin/padding/gap issue but a positioning issue
- Previous attempts to fix margins/padding/flexbox layout did not resolve the issue
- This is the third attempt to fix this very simple CSS issue

## Steps to Recreate
1. Navigate to localhost:5173
2. Click the 'Inquire Now' button to open the modal
3. Observe the excessive spacing between the 'STUDENT NAME' label and the input field below it
4. Notice the gap is significantly larger than expected for normal form spacing

## Attempts to Solve the Problem
- First attempt: Adjusted margin and padding values in CSS (form-group, form-label, form-row margins)
- Second attempt: Removed position: relative and added flexbox layout to inquiry-modal-content
- Previous investigation in 'modal_spacing_investigation.md' falsely asserted the issue was understood and resolved
- User confirmed this is NOT a margin/padding/gap issue but specifically a positioning issue
- All previous attempts have failed to resolve the visual spacing problem

## Hypotheses

1. **CSS Grid Layout Issue** (Most Fundamental)
   - hypothesis: The form layout is using CSS Grid with incorrect row gaps or grid-template-rows
   - null hypothesis: CSS Grid layout is not causing the spacing issue

2. **Absolute/Fixed Positioning**
   - hypothesis: Elements are using absolute or fixed positioning that creates visual gaps
   - null hypothesis: No absolute/fixed positioning is affecting element layout

3. **CSS Transform or Translate**
   - hypothesis: CSS transforms or translate properties are moving elements out of their natural position
   - null hypothesis: No CSS transforms are affecting element positioning

4. **Line Height or Font Properties**
   - hypothesis: Excessive line-height, font-size, or other typography properties are creating spacing
   - null hypothesis: Typography properties are not causing excessive spacing

5. **Flexbox Alignment Issues**
   - hypothesis: Flexbox properties (align-items, justify-content, align-self) are creating unexpected spacing
   - null hypothesis: Flexbox alignment properties are working correctly

6. **CSS Box Model Issues**
   - hypothesis: Box-sizing, display properties, or content-box vs border-box is causing layout issues
   - null hypothesis: Box model properties are consistent and correct

7. **Inherited CSS Styles**
   - hypothesis: Parent container styles are being inherited and affecting form element positioning
   - null hypothesis: No inherited styles are causing positioning conflicts

8. **Browser Default Styles** (Most Dependent)
   - hypothesis: Browser default styles for form elements are creating unexpected spacing
   - null hypothesis: Browser defaults are not interfering with custom styles

## Investigation Process
Following systematic null hypothesis testing:
1. Use Puppeteer to visually document the current issue
2. Test each hypothesis with live application evidence
3. Use browser developer tools to inspect computed styles
4. Make targeted changes and verify with visual evidence
5. Continue until root cause is identified and resolved
