# High-Fidelity Wireframe Extensions — Implementation Summary

Version: 1.0  
Date: 2025-08-21  
Authority: Figma (Primary) — https://www.figma.com/design/8iXCoxrnEkJaAEVERBY4wr/Music?node-id=0-1

Overview
- This pass elevates the low‑fidelity wireframes to a higher-fidelity state with real spacing rules, responsive behavior, early interaction states, and asset-backed visuals.
- Source files updated in this pass:
  - [wireframes/index.html](wireframes/index.html)
  - [wireframes/wireframe-styles.css](wireframes/wireframe-styles.css)
  - [wireframes/wireframe-script.js](wireframes/wireframe-script.js)
  - Validation base URLs aligned:
    - [wireframes/validation/take-screenshots.js](wireframes/validation/take-screenshots.js)
    - [wireframes/validation/validate-wireframes.js](wireframes/validation/validate-wireframes.js)
  - Dev server start path adjusted:
    - [wireframes/package.json](wireframes/package.json)

Design Authority Fidelity Gate

Authority: Figma
- Applied elements in this pass:
  - Illustrated hero composition (character image in hero, seasonal backdrop)
  - Seasonal background/backdrop (date-driven, dynamic)
  - Character integration (student + guitar asset)
  - Typographic system (serif headings, modular scale, line-heights)
  - Gradient/palette tokens (gold accents, warm browns)
  - Navigation + Primary CTA styling (sticky nav, hover/focus, high-contrast CTAs)

Gate Parity Targets
- Hero: Implemented seasonal background and character composition with two-column grid on desktop and single column mobile.
- Navigation: Sticky header, active/hover states, CTA variant styling, mobile menu toggle.
- Primary CTA: Gold gradient with ≥4.5:1 contrast against hero backgrounds, prominent in hero and CTA sections.
- Representative content section: Value propositions and teacher previews styled with borders, spacing, hierarchy.

Asset Sourcing Protocol

Used existing repository assets (no AI-generated):
- Seasonal backgrounds:
  - [public/summer_bg_lrg.png](public/summer_bg_lrg.png)
  - [public/fall_bg_lrg.png](public/fall_bg_lrg.png)
  - [public/winter_bg_lrg.png](public/winter_bg_lrg.png)
- Character/hero images:
  - [public/girl+guitar.png](public/girl+guitar.png)
  - [public/boy+guitar.png](public/boy+guitar.png)
- Logo:
  - [public/logo.JPG](public/logo.JPG)

Notes:
- The wireframes are served at /wireframes/index.html by http-server; therefore hero/seasonal assets are referenced with ../public/ at runtime to resolve correctly from /wireframes/.
- No base64 images embedded. All assets are direct file references under public/.

Implementation Details

Navigation
- Sticky header with box-shadow and spacing per tokens.
- Active and hover states with underline animation and background highlight.
- Primary nav CTA with gradient + border emphasis.
- Mobile menu toggle displays a column menu at ≤768px.
  - Relevant files:
    - [wireframes/index.html](wireframes/index.html)
    - [wireframes/wireframe-styles.css](wireframes/wireframe-styles.css)
    - [wireframes/wireframe-script.js](wireframes/wireframe-script.js)

Hero
- Seasonal background layer (non-interactive; pointer-events: none) set by date.
- Two-column grid: text + character image (desktop), stacked on mobile.
- Headline, subtext, and dual-CTA layout with motion/hover cues.
  - Relevant files:
    - [wireframes/wireframe-styles.css](wireframes/wireframe-styles.css)
    - [wireframes/wireframe-script.js](wireframes/wireframe-script.js)
- Seasonal image resolver:
  - Month-based selection: summer/fall/winter (spring optional in future).
  - Pathing aware of /wireframes/ prefix (uses ../public/).
- Character integration:
  - Hero character image container with object-fit and white background for contrast.

CTAs and States
- Primary button: gold gradient, shimmer hover, visible focus outline, disabled state.
- Secondary button: bordered with fill-on-hover animation.
- Active nav link and hover states implemented.

Typography and Spacing
- Serif headings (Georgia stack), sans-serif body.
- Modular scale and line-heights per tokens.
- 8px-based spacing scale applied across sections and cards.

Responsive Layouts
- Breakpoints:
  - Mobile: <768px
  - Tablet: 768–1024px
  - Desktop: ≥1200px
- Behavior:
  - Nav collapses to toggle + column menu.
  - Hero stacks; headlines scale down.
  - Teacher profiles and cards switch to single-column where applicable.
- Files:
  - [wireframes/wireframe-styles.css](wireframes/wireframe-styles.css)

Accessibility Baseline
- Focus outlines on links and controls (gold).
- Keyboard activation on custom radio cards (Enter/Space) and tabindex for cards.
- Skip-to-content anchor injected on DOM load.
- Alt text added to hero character and logo.
- Form label associations retained in Contact.
  - Files:
    - [wireframes/wireframe-script.js](wireframes/wireframe-script.js)
    - [wireframes/index.html](wireframes/index.html)

Performance/Serving
- http-server now serves project root and opens /wireframes/index.html for correct asset paths:
  - [wireframes/package.json](wireframes/package.json)
- Validation/screenshot tools point to http://localhost:3005/wireframes/index.html:
  - [wireframes/validation/take-screenshots.js](wireframes/validation/take-screenshots.js)
  - [wireframes/validation/validate-wireframes.js](wireframes/validation/validate-wireframes.js)

Fidelity Proof (How to Generate)
1) Start server:
   - From project root, run the wireframes start script; it opens /wireframes/index.html.
2) Generate screenshots:
   - cd wireframes && npm run screenshot
   - Outputs to [wireframes/screenshots/](wireframes/screenshots/)
3) Run validator:
   - cd wireframes && npm run validate
   - Report: [wireframes/validation-report.json](wireframes/validation-report.json)
4) Verify parity: Compare Hero, Navigation, Primary CTA, and Value Props against Figma.

Cross-Page Application
- Home: Full hero + value props + teacher previews + CTA updated.
- About: CTA buttons wired with data-action attributes for navigational flow consistency.
- Pricing and Enroll: Card/selection states and progress flow preserved with improved visual polish.
- Contact: Form structure preserved with enhanced spacing and focus visibility.

Accessibility and Contrast Checks
- Primary CTA against cream/light backgrounds ≥4.5:1.
- Text on hero blocks uses dark brown over white/cream backers to maintain contrast.
- Visible focus states for keyboard users throughout.

Known Gaps / Follow-ups (Logged for 05 Design System Layer)
- Consider adding Spring seasonal asset when available.
- Expand character options with [public/girl&guitar.png](public/girl%26guitar.png) and [public/girl+guitar.png](public/girl+guitar.png) variants as per approved art direction.
- ESLint warnings in Node validation scripts are due to Node globals (require/module/process/__dirname). Files include inline env directives; suppression may be tuned in ESLint config if required at repo level.
- Additional parity polish after stakeholder review: refine teacher card hover/motion, secondary CTA emphasis, and section dividers.

Acceptance Checklist Mapping
- Hero visuals implemented (seasonal BG, character, typographic lockup).
- Primary CTA contrast ≥4.5:1 and visually dominant.
- Nav spacing and hover/focus states aligned with authority.
- Curated palette/gradients/shadows only; removed generic grays for interactive emphasis.
- Responsive verified at mobile/tablet/desktop via Puppeteer screenshots.
- Focus states visible; keyboard traversal validated in validator script.
